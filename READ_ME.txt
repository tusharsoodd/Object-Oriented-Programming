Assignment 1: Connect4

Description: This Project recreates the Connect-4 game digitally using Java. A picture of the 3 main classes of the MVC architecture is in the Report.

Note: The file Connect4.java, containing the main method has been renamed to Main.java.

Installation and running: The submission has been formatted according to the assignment instructions, containing the 5 java files in the src folder. IntelliJ gives numerous errors if the files are put directly into the src folder, without the com.company package. So if the editor declares errors, that might be the reason, and you should try putting the 5 java classes into a "com.company" package in the src folder.
